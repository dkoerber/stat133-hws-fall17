Warm-Up 01 - Stat 133, Fall 2017

================

**Due date:** Saturday Sep-09, 2017 (before midnight)

The purpose of this assignment is to work with an `Rmd` file and practice writing content using markdown syntax.

You will be using R markdown files, aka `Rmd` files, throughout the rest of the course. So the sooner you get familiar with the markdown syntax, the better. Hopefully, after finishing the course, you will ditch (or at least minimize the use of) office-like software and switch to a combination of markdown file(s)---with R or other compatible software---to make your assignments or prepare any other type of document.

Although this HW is a *dummy* assignment (i.e. it won't count towards your final grade), please take it as an inexpensive opportunity to tackle any logistic problems, and make sure R, RStudio, bCourses, and your computer work nicely---without being penalized. Later on you will also include version control tools such as Git and Github.

Here are some useful resources that you can consult to complete this assignment:

Requirements
------------

Here's a summary of the topics you have to write about. You don't have to write any R code (yet).

1.  [Cooking Recipe](#cooking-recipe)
2.  [Quadratic Equation](#quadratic-equation)
3.  [Comments and Reflections](#comments-and-reflections)

Make sure to include the following elements (using markdown syntax)

-   Use various types of headings
-   Use text in italics
-   Use text in bold
-   Hyperlinks
-   Links of images
-   A table
-   Unordered list
-   Ordered list
-   Blockquote
-   Breaklines
-   Some math equations

### Cooking Recipe

Write about your favorite cooking recipe (or any other recipe). You can write a recipe for a breakfast, or a fancy cocktail, or anything you like.

-   Use an **unordered** list (of bullets) to list the ingredients.
-   Use another unordered list to list any "special" kitchen tools that are needed.
-   Use an ordered list to list and describe all the steps of the recipe.
-   If possible, look for an image online that you could insert to show the appearance of the meal (plate, drink, etc).
-   Or even better, take a picture of the outcome and include it in your document!
-   Also include a description of when to use the recipe?
-   Is there a special season of the year for it?
-   Are there variations of the recipe? Using other ingredients?

### Frozen Lemonade Ice Cream Pie

#### Ingredients

-   1 quart of vanilla ice cream
-   6 oz of frozen lemonade extract
-   1 1/4 cups of crushed pretzels
-   1/2 cup of melted butter
-   1/4 cup sugar

#### Kitchen Tools/Dishes

-   Circular pie dish
-   Electric mixer
-   Freezer

#### Directions

1.  Leave the ice cream and frozen lemonade extract out to thaw slightly, crush the pretzels, and melt the butter.
2.  Mix the crushed pretzels, sugar, and melted butter together in a bowl.
3.  Dump the pretzel crust mixture into the pie dish and form the crust to the base and sides of the dish. Freeze for 15 minutes.
4.  In a larger bowl, use the electric mixer to combine the thawed ice cream and lemonade extract.
5.  Once mixed to the consistency of a milkshake, remove your pie crust from the oven and pour the ice cream filling into the dish.
6.  Freeze for 4 hours or until solid, and enjoy!

#### Notes

Frozen lemonade ice cream pie is best enjoyed on a hot summer day! The salty and buttery pretzel crust perfectly complements the tangy sweetness of the lemonade ice cream pie filling. If a yellow color for the filling is desired, yellow food coloring may be added; the lemonade extract sometimes doesn't add enough yellow to overcome the white of the vanilla ice cream.

### Quadratic Equation

Visit the wikipedia page for the quadratic equation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation>

Write the general form of a quadratic equation, and provide a brief description for it. Also, write the quadratic formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation. This will require that you use latex syntax. Here are a couple of resources about writing math symbols with Latex notation:

-   <https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Mathematical_expressions>

-   <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics>

If you feel the quadratic is not enough, feel free to find other math equations and formulas to play with.

#### General form of a quadratic equation

The general form of a quadratic equation follows the form
*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *x* = 0
 where *x* is some unknown variable, and *a*, *b*, and *c* are constants. The constant *a* must not be equal to 0, otherwise the equation is *linear* because the /(x^2/) term is equal to 0.

#### Quadratic formula for the roots of a general quadratic equation

$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{-b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
 This formula is used to find the *roots*, or *zeros*, of a quadratic equation.

### Comments and Reflections

Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. Here are some questions that you can start with to provide comments on your HW.

-   What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?
    -   I was originally confused about how to break lines of text into multiple lines, but the markdown tutorials were excellent tools to learn how to manipulate how my text is displayed.
-   What was easy(-ish) even though we haven't done it in class?
    -   Creating headers with the \# was simple, as well as making words **bold** and *italicized*.
-   Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it?
    -   This is my first time using markdown syntax. I really like it so far, it's nice to be able to type a few hashtags if I want a big header, rather than play around with the font size and spacing in MS Word. I also find it amazing how simple it is to hyperlink websites to any part of the text that I type.
-   If you have used markdown before, was there something new you learned while doing this assignment?
    -   N/A
-   Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?
    -   I didn't need help completing the assignment.
-   How much time did it take to complete this HW?
    -   It took me about 1.5 hours to complete this assignment and familiarize myself with markdown.
-   What was the most time consuming part?
    -   The most time consuming part of this assignemnt was searching around to find the right ways to display mathematical equations.

Submission
----------

Name your `Rmd` file using the following structure: `up01-first-last.Rmd` where "first" and "last" are your first and last names. E.g. `up01-gaston-sanchez.Rmd`.

Please submit your source `.Rmd` file, as well as the knitted (i.e. compiled) html file to bCourses.

*Note: later (in two weeks or so) you will have to upload your `.Rmd` file to your github repository (don't worry if you don't know what this means).*
