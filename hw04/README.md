No notes


### Run an app from a subdirectory in the repo
```{r}
library(shiny)

```

### 7) Comments and Reflections
Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.
#### Was this your first time writing unit tests?
Yes, this was my first time writing unit tests.
#### On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing you found the logic of testthat tests? (0 not at all, 10 very confusing)

#### Was this your first time working with ggvis?
Outside of lab and lecture, this was my first time working with ggvis.
#### On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing you found the syntax of ggvis? (0 not at all, 10 very confusing)

#### So far weâ€™ve exposed you to three graphing paradigms in R: base plots, ggplot, and now ggvis. Which do you like the most and why?
I like ggplot the most because it makes sense to me.  I would rather build shiny apps that use ggplot instead of ggvis because I feel like ggplot is more intuitive.
#### Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who?
No one helped me.
#### How much time did it take to complete this HW?
I'd say around 15 hours.
#### What was the most time consuming part?
The most time consuming part was by far building the shiny app.  I was also stuck on a problem for about 2 hours, only to find out that I had referened tab3 instead of tab2.
